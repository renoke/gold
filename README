Introduction
============

This is the workflow we use when developing zena.

The main idea is that developers work on feature branches on their fork and send an
email to the reviewer when work is ready. The reviewer pulls from these branches,
checks that all is good and either apply the commits to the gold master or abort.

There is a script called 'gold' that helps use this workflow once the remote references
are added.

Any questions ? Ask zena's mailing list: http://zenadmin.org/en/community

Workflow
========

Developer setup
---------------

1. login on github (John)
2. fork sandbox
3. on local machine, clone your own fork
> git clone git@github.com:john/sandbox.git
> git remote add zena git://github.com/zena/sandbox.git
> git fetch zena
> git checkout --track -b zena zena/master  # this is the gold master for zena

Working on new 'floppy' feature
-------------------------------

[John] (developer, on his own fork)
> git co -b floppy
> commit, commit
> push origin floppy

[zena] (reviewer)
> git remote add john git://github.com/john/sandbox.git
> git fetch john
> git co -b john/floppy   # why not --track ?
# review --> no good

[John]
> reset, commit, squash, etc
> git push origin +floppy   # force floppy sync

[zena]
> git co master
> git branch -D john/floppy   # we would not need this with --track...
> git co -b john/floppy
> git rebase master
# ok
> git co master
> git merge --ff john/floppy
> git branch -D john/floppy
> git push
